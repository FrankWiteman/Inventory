This is a working class Inventory. It was created for an Auto Sales company, however it can be modified to personal use
I created it with a locally saved function.i.e. it can save the inventory to your local machine a.k.a Excel format, also includes the function to print the PDF format of inventories entered in the file
It can also import excel files too, so if you have an inventory stored elsewhere, and when you run the program, it can upload the excel file to the system and it can read it, then store it in the newly created inventory file.
While this is a work in progress, it will be updated everynow and then to meet the specification of the current user, however modify it to your own needs.
There are occasional errors on it and will be working on them to correct them every now and then but the basic necessities of the program has been completed
